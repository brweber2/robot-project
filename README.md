# robot-project

Documentation for robot build out (hardware and software).

This is a mix of various open source projects and a couple of books.

* [Build Your Own Robot: Using Python, CRICKIT, and Raspberry PI](https://www.amazon.com/Build-Your-Own-Robot-Raspberry/dp/1633438457)
  * NOTE: that this project does NOT use a CRICKIT but this book is a good starting point to learn robotics concepts
* [Make: Robotic Arms](https://www.amazon.com/Make-Robotic-Arms-Matthew-Eaton/dp/1680458434)
  * code on GITHUB: https://github.com/ACBRrobotics/Make_Robotic_Arms
